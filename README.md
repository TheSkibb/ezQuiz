# EZ quiz

Simple flashcard program.
Takes as argument the location of a markdown file to read as flash cards.

The markdown file needs to be on the format:

~~~md
# Category

## question

answer

## question 2

answer 2
~~~

When running the program you will be presented with a shell. Press enter to select a random question from the markdown file

**NOTICE: your document has to start with category (single "#") before any questions**

# subdivider

if you are like me and like to have all of the questions in one big file, you can use the subdivider to create a file for each section (divided by single "#") which can make it easier to just practice one topic

**when running subdivider.go make sure you are in the same directory as you wish for your subdivided files to be written to**
